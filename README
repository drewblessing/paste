# Paste

A simple (and tiny) Pastie clone written on Sinatra with DataMapper. 
Originally created by Nick Plante with contributions from Dave Everitt.
See original project at https://github.com/zapnap/toopaste

This Pastie app was written to fill a need for a secure, internal paste service
in the enterprise.  This like GitHub Gist and Paste Bin are not appropriate
for sensitive information, logs, etc.

It currently stores data in Sqlite with future plans to support MySQL.
